## Hardware project

This is a poncho project of a bunch of hardware.

- Nerves Firmware is a project which is intended to work in a Raspberry pi 3 model B, but it should not be hard to move to other device.
- arduino UNO, this board is super old so this project is a regular C project done with AVR stdlib.
- Atom VM firmware is a project which is inteaded to work in a raspberry pi pico 2W. Again it should not be hard to move it, to any other ATOM VM target.

## ROADMAP

- [X] Make ATOMVM work in the Raspberry pi pico 2W
- [ ] Make some sensors work with the Rasberry pi pico 
- [X] Built an Agent in the Nerves device which can handle the hardware and make calls into the tools provided, sensors, LCD and so on ...
